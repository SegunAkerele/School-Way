            <p>If you have ever seen where people talk down a subject or ask why a subject 
                is included in the school curriculum, you will know how vital this programme
                 is.</p><br>
                
            <p>How many careers are there in the world? Only a few schoolers in Nigeria can 
                answer this question correctly, saying “uncountable.”  Why? That is because a 
                career advice programme is rare in our schools. When organised, the number of 
                careers is often narrowed to six or seven, including doctor, lawyer, engineer, 
                banker, pilot, artiste, security personnel, and businessman or woman. Most 
                young people in underserved communities in Nigeria don't get career advice 
                throughout their secondary school days – unless when they discuss it among 
                themselves. How many of them know there are more careers than they would 
                list? No wonder many young people often dream small.</p><br>
                
            <p>As students must learn about everything in the classroom, they must also know 
                about the job market. That will help them make connections between learning in 
                school and a career. Many students undermine and question the inclusion of 
                certain subjects in their curriculum because they think they are irrelevant to them 
                since they can hardly connect the subject to any career. Most do not want to learn 
                some things when they can’t make connections. Those connections are crucial as 
                they help them realise the importance of learning in school and using those skills 
                in their future career.</p><br>
                
            <p>This aspect of our programme is designed to inform the participants how big the 
                world is, the careers out there, and how they can get the job they want. The world 
                is big, but our students have a narrow view of its opportunities because they don’t 
                see beyond their communities. However, it is a big world with lots of opportunities 
                for them to be anything they want. Through this programme, we aim to inspire the 
                participants and make their learning meaningful by connecting the dots between 
                their education and different careers worldwide. To show them a world full of 
                opportunities where their choice of career can and will prosper if things are 
                done correctly.
