            <h1>Why this Inintiative?</h1>
            <p>The leadership problem in Africa is little about competency but more about 
                a sense of responsibility. Most African leaders hardly feel they are in 
                their positions for their people, communities, and countries. But if we ask 
                ourselves why most of these leaders lack a sense of responsibility, we can 
                always trance the causes to their childhood.
            </p>
            <p>One thing history has taught us about leaders is that no one can stop a 
                potential young leader from becoming a leader in their future circles. 
                Nothing else aside from death – not poverty or ignorance or illiteracy. The 
                worst is that they will become irresponsible leaders who fail at school, 
                in relationships, in careers, and leadership positions.
            </p>
            <p>No one intentionally learns to be irresponsible. However, many people grow to 
                become irresponsible because the process is very subtle that it has become so 
                rampant among many students. Evidence of irresponsibility among 
                students today includes avoiding copying notes, not studying to write tests 
                or exams, waiting for another person to do something, feeling punished when 
                asked to do something, etc. These are acts of irresponsibility in the 
                making. Such children will grow up to become irresponsible leaders.
            </p>
            <p>A sense of responsibility is not a virtue that can easily be inculcated 
                overnight, especially by adults. An adult who did not grow up taking 
                selfless responsible actions as a child or teenager would hardly take a step 
                towards solving common problems as a community leader. That is why children 
                in school must be intentionally equipped with the right mindset of being 
                responsible leaders in their communities and environments since mere being 
                in school is no longer enough to help children grow appropriately into 
                responsible adults.
            </p>
            <p>Complementing school’s effort in that regard is the main essence of ReMDI.</p>
            
            <br><img src="Image/remdi-launch.JPG" width="100%"><br><br><br>
    
            <h1>The Initiative</h1>
            <p>Responsibility Mindset Development Initiative (ReMDI) is a project-based 
                learning platform where students are engaged to develop skills, such as a 
                problem-solving skill, critical thinking skill, etc. and a sense of 
                responsibility toward their personal growth, families, and the development 
                of their communities.
            </p>
            <p>In schools, ReMDI is established as a School Club for students, functioning 
                as a learning hub where the members are engaged in discussions on how to 
                attain academic excellence, develop soft and leadership skills as well as 
                a positive character, are encouraged to dream big, are provided with 
                leadership books, playing educative games, such as Legacy that helps them 
                envision a future with or without adequate knowledge acquisition, and 
                participate in voluntary social activities of the club within the school 
                compound through which they develop leadership and other soft skills.
            </p>
            <p>The objectives of the initiative are to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Guide students into becoming responsible adults;</li>
                    <li>Prepare students to become influential positive impact makers in 
                        their communities;</li>
                    <li>Motivate students towards intensive knowledge acquisition and 
                        self-development;</li>
                    <li>Encourage students to make better career choices, among many others.</li>
                    <li>Guide students to develop essential soft and leadership skills 
                        necessary to achieve their big dreams as responsible young people.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>We want to see young people who will genuinely take responsibility for 
                Self-development and positive growth for the well-being of their families 
                and the development of their communities.
            </p>

            <br><img src="Image/remdi's project.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>

            <p>The initiative accommodates both male and female students of secondary 
                schools as members of the club without discrimination in any form. Its 
                membership is open to all the students of the host school.
            </p>
            <p>However, the initiative's members are grouped into full and participating 
                members. A participating member is every interested student of the host 
                school. In contrast, full members are a few elected students among the 
                interested students in particular positions of responsibility in the 
                club. These selected students will act as the coordinators of the club’s 
                activities under the supervision of whomever the school chooses as the 
                director of the club among the teachers. They are the initiative’s 
                ambassadors who plan the club’s weekly activities and see to its 
                growth.
            </p>
            <p>To become a full member of the initiative, such a student must be a 
                committed and active club member who attains distinction in English 
                Studies, Mathematics, or Basic Science and must earn credit in at least 
                nine other subjects.
            </p>
            <p>The club's Facilitators’ Manual is prepared to help effectively facilitate 
                the club’s activities.
            </p>
            <h2>Our focus is to instill in students a sense of responsibility towards 
                self and community development while also developing leadership skills. 
                Our effort is to see our members become citizens who respond to issues 
                affecting people and their communities in the future.
