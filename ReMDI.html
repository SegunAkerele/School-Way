        <h1>Why this Inintiative?</h1>
        <p>The leadership problem in Nigeria is little about competency but more about 
            being and feeling responsible. Most African leaders hardly feel they are in 
            their positions for their people, communities, and countries. But if we ask 
            ourselves why most African leaders lack a sense of responsibility, we can 
            always trance the causes to their childhood.
        </p>
        <p>One thing history has taught us about leaders is that no one can stop a 
            potential young leader from becoming a leader in their future circles. 
            Nothing else aside from death – not poverty or ignorance or illiteracy. The 
            worst is that they will become irresponsible leaders who fail at school, 
            in relationships, in careers, and leadership positions.
        </p>
        <p>Learning to be irresponsible is very subtle that it is so rampant amongst 
            students today without knowing it. Evidence of irresponsibility among 
            students today includes avoiding copying notes, not studying to write tests 
            or exams, waiting for another person to do something, feeling punished when 
            asked to do something, etc. These are acts of irresponsibility in the 
            making. Such children will grow up to become irresponsible leaders.
        </p>
        <p>A sense of responsibility is not a virtue that can easily be inculcated 
            overnight, especially by adults. An adult who did not grow up taking 
            selfless responsible actions as a child or teenager would hardly take a step 
            towards solving common problems as a community leader. That is why children 
            in school must be intentionally equipped with the right mindset of being 
            responsible leaders in their communities and environments since mere being 
            in school is no longer enough to help children grow appropriately into 
            responsible adults.
        </p>
        <p>Complementing school’s effort in that regard is the main essence of ReMDI.</p>

        <h1>The Initiative</h1>
        <p>Responsibility Mindset Development Initiative (ReMDI) is a project-based 
            learning platform where students are engaged to develop skills and a sense 
            of responsibility toward their personal growth, their families, and the 
            development of their communities.
        </p>
        <p>In schools, ReMDI is established as a School Club for students, functioning 
            as a learning hub where the members are engaged in discussions on how to 
            attain academic excellence, develop soft and leadership skills as well as 
            a positive character, are encouraged to dream big, are provided with 
            leadership books, playing educative games, such as Legacy that helps them 
            envision a future with or without adequate knowledge acquisition, and 
            participate in voluntary social activities of the club within the school 
            compound through which they develop leadership and other soft skills.
        </p>
        <p>The objectives of the initiative are to:
            <ul>
                <li>Guide students into becoming responsible adults;</li>
                <li>Prepare students to become influential positive impact makers in 
                    their communities;</li>
                <li>Motivate students towards intensive knowledge acquisition and 
                    self-development;</li>
                <li>Encourage students to make better career choices, among many others.</li>
                <li>Guide students to develop essential soft and leadership skills 
                    necessary to achieve their big dreams as responsible young people.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>We want to see young people who will genuinely take responsibility for 
            Self-development and positive growth for the well-being of their families 
            and the development of their communities.
        </p>
        <p>The initiative accommodates both male and female students of secondary 
            schools as members of the club without discrimination in any form. Its 
            membership is open to all the students of the host school.
        </p>
        <p>However, the initiative's members are grouped into full and participating 
            members. A participating member is every interested student of the host 
            school. In contrast, full members are a few elected students among the 
            interested students in particular positions of responsibility in the 
            club. These selected students will act as the coordinators of the club’s 
            activities under the supervision of whomever the school chooses as the 
            director of the club among the teachers. They are the initiative’s 
            ambassadors who plan the club’s weekly activities and see to its 
            growth.
        </p>
        <p>To become a full member of the initiative, such a student must be a 
            committed and active club member who attains distinction in English 
            Studies, Mathematics, or Basic Science and must earn credit in at least 
            nine other subjects.
        </p>
        <p>The club's Facilitators’ Manual is prepared to help effectively facilitate 
            the club’s activities.
        </p>
        <h2>Our focus is to instill in students a sense of responsibility towards 
            self and community development while also developing leadership skills. 
            Our effort is to see our members become citizens who respond to issues 
            affecting people and their communities in the future.
